        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Colombian Arepas are a beloved traditional dish, simple yet versatile, deeply rooted in Colombia's culinary culture. Colombian arepas are known for their versatility. They can be enjoyed plain or split open and stuffed with a variety of fillings like cheese, ham, or scrambled eggs. In some regions, they're also topped with butter or served with accompaniments like avocado or hogao, a traditional Colombian sauce made from tomatoes, onions, garlic, and cilantro. The result is a delightful combination of crunchy exterior and soft, warm interior, making arepas a comfort food enjoyed at any time of the day, from breakfast to dinner, reflecting the rich and diverse culinary traditions of Colombia.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups of pre-cooked white cornmeal (masarepa)</li>
            <li>2 to 2 1/2 cups of warm water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>Optional: grated cheese, butter for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a large bowl, mix the pre-cooked cornmeal (masarepa) and salt.</li>
                    <li>Gradually add the warm water, stirring continuously to avoid lumps. Start with 2 cups of water, adding more if the dough feels too dry.</li>
                    <li>Knead the dough for a few minutes until it becomes smooth and pliable. It should not stick to your hands. If it's too dry, add a little more water; if too wet, add a bit more cornmeal.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Shape the Arepas:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Divide the dough into equal portions, rolling each into a ball. The size of the balls can vary depending on your preferred arepa size.</li>
                    <li>Flatten each ball between your palms or against a flat surface to form a disc about 1/2-inch thick.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Cook the Arepas:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Preheat a griddle or a non-stick pan over medium heat.</li>
                    <li>Place the arepas on the griddle and cook for about 5-7 minutes on each side, or until they have a nice golden crust and sound hollow when tapped.</li>
                    <li>Flip them occasionally for even cooking.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Serve the Arepas warm.</li>
                    <li>They can be split open and stuffed with your choice of fillings such as cheese, ham, or scrambled eggs.</li>
                    <li>Alternatively, serve them plain, with butter, or with traditional accompaniments like avocado or hogao.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
